## Analytics and automation
- WebNN
    - For AI models, although WebGPU can also be used for acceleration
    - e.g. to implement "prediction" function below by training a model
- Simulation
    - e.g. generate continuous 2D image from localized sensor readings of pollution, taking into account wind, etc.
- Automation rules (when this is true, do that, aka IFTTT)
    - Notifications (when this is true, signal event via this mechanism)
- Statistical analysis of historical data
    - e.g. How does current energy consumption/traffic/air quality etc. compare to this time last year?
- Predictive models/forecasts
   - Weather being the most obvious one, but also traffic, air quality, energy consumption, etc.
