# smart-cities

Work area for the Web-based Digital Twins for Smart Cities IG

## Regular Meeting
The IG's monthly call is held on the fourth Monday at 9am Eastern to
avoid the conflict with the Working Group Standards & Platforms.

We use the [W3C IRC channel](https://irc.w3.org/?channels=smart-cities) as well to take notes during the monthly calls.
